# Tic-tac-toe Machine Learning

Welcome to the Tic-tac-toe Machine Learning repository! This project aims to develop a sophisticated AI opponent for the classic tic-tac-toe game using machine learning techniques. By training models to predict optimal moves, this project provides an interactive and challenging gaming experience.

## Project Overview

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks and pre-trained model weights that outline different strategies and complexities of machine learning models designed to play tic-tac-toe. Players can engage with different difficulty levels of AI, or even play against a human-like AI in various configurations.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks**:
  - `tictac-log.ipynb` - Logs and visualizes the gameplay data and AI decision-making process.
  - `tictac-onlyagent-diff-weight.ipynb` - Demonstrates gameplay between different AI models with varying weights.
  - `tictac-with-humen-gui.ipynb` - Features a GUI for playing against the AI with a human-like interface.
  - `tictac-with-humen.ipynb` - Allows gameplay directly against an AI simulating human gameplay.

- **Model Weights**:
  - `tic_tac_toe_weights_easy.pkl` - Weights for an AI trained with basic strategies.
  - `tic_tac_toe_weights_medium.pkl` - Weights for an AI with intermediate strategies.
  - `tic_tac_toe_weights_hard.pkl` - Weights for an AI using advanced strategies.
  - Additional weights for agent variations (`agent_1` and `agent_2`).

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Primary programming language for simulation and model training.
- **Jupyter Notebook** - For interactive code execution and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow** - For machine learning model development.
